# Ghost Protocols

Store your characterâ€™s psychological and moral profile across scenarios. Update after major story beats or at the end of each session.

Each file should be named like: `ghost_protocol_v1.md`, `ghost_protocol_v2.md`, etc.

Use the template in `/tools/ghost_protocol_template.md`.
