DESCENT INTO MADNESS

Player Campaign Introduction

A Vampire: The Masquerade Chronicle

# Campaign Overview

Welcome to *Descent into Madness*, a personal, gothic horror campaign for Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition. This story follows your character from the last days of their mortal life through their transformation into a vampire and their descent into a shadowy conspiracy.

The game focuses on themes of:
- Humanity vs. the Beast
- Psychological pressure and moral testing
- Connection, betrayal, and hidden agendas

You will play through a series of solo story scenarios that slowly interweave with other players' experiences. Your choices matter. How you act and evolve determines what your character becomes‚Äîand how others experience you in the story.

# How It Works

‚Ä¢ Each scenario is played solo with the help of ChatGPT.
‚Ä¢ You will upload a scenario document and use a short prompt to begin.
‚Ä¢ ChatGPT will act as the storyteller and narrator.
‚Ä¢ You will be asked to make choices, roll dice, and reflect on your actions.
‚Ä¢ At times, you may encounter other player characters controlled by ChatGPT using their submitted ‚ÄúGhost Protocol Sheet.‚Äù

After each scenario, you‚Äôll submit your results to the GM.

# Before You Begin

You will need:
- A completed character sheet (attributes, abilities, clan, disciplines)
- The Ghost Protocol Sheet (personality summary)
- Results or notes from previous scenarios

If this is your first scenario, you only need the scenario document and the starting prompt.
