## Scenario 3 Summary – Echoes in Blood
The descent rattled Iris more than she’ll admit. When Ransom shattered the heart, she didn’t laugh. She *watched*. The Falcon isn’t just a riddle now—it’s something she *almost* understands. And that scares her more than anything.

## Updated Character Reflection

> “The difference between a mask and a lie? One peels off. The other clings.”

**Growth**:
- Iris is evolving from comic relief to razor-edged misdirection  
- She’s beginning to treat the Falcon not as mystery, but opponent  
- Her illusions now hide purpose, not just pain

**Fears**:
- That her playfulness is the only thing holding her sanity together  
- That she might be a puppet in someone else’s con  
- That she’s not the trickster… but the trick
