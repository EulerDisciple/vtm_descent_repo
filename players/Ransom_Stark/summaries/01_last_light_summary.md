**Ransom Stark’s descent in Scenario 1** begins not with blood, but with cold. Slumped in the corner of an abandoned high-rise, he reflects on a life already unraveling. The military discharged him, society discarded him, and Ringo—his last tether to something resembling purpose—betrayed him. What began as simple courier work turned into something darker: satchels ferried between gleaming corporate fronts and seedy back alleys, until a drop went bad and Ransom became the liability. Haunted by that betrayal and hunted by unseen forces, Ransom clings to the wreckage of his instincts and routines, desperate to make sense of what went wrong.

His return to Straton’s pub is a bid for answers, not safety. Familiar places no longer offer sanctuary; they only confirm how far he’s fallen. Ransom discovers he's being watched—not just by old contacts like Needle, but by something stranger. The falcon sigil marks his path. Conversations become confessions, and revelations come wrapped in silence and dread. A feather on a bar stool, a blank card with a burned-in number—omens more than clues. He learns of the *Burial Group*, a shadowy faction with designs on whatever Ringo stumbled into. And worse, someone—or something—is keeping tabs on him.

When he reaches the Chapel, it’s as if fate draws him there. Ringo lies broken at the altar, a man hollowed out by deals he couldn’t comprehend. And from the shadows, **she** descends—the woman in black. The one who has watched, waited, and now claims Ransom as hers. He doesn’t beg. He doesn’t fight. Instead, he stalls with a soldier’s discipline and a survivor’s cynicism: *What does living mean to you?* The answer is hunger, power, and the shedding of illusions. And then—pain, blood, and a kiss colder than death.

Ransom’s Embrace isn’t an accident. It’s a conclusion. A consequence. He drinks because some part of him still wants to live—not as he was, but as something *capable* of enduring this new world. When he rises, he is no longer a discarded man fleeing a failed courier job. He is a neonate with blood in his mouth, a falcon on his trail, and a mystery buried in his very veins. Ransom doesn’t trust what he’s become. But he knows it’s better than being prey.
