VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE

Quick Reference Guide for Scenario 2

For New Players

# Core Mechanics

Vampire: The Masquerade uses a dice pool system based on the sum of an Attribute and an Ability.

For example:
Dexterity (3) + Stealth (2) = Roll 5d10

Each die that rolls a 6 or higher counts as a success. One success usually means partial success; more successes often mean better outcomes. 0 successes or a 1 with no successes is a failure (or possible botch).

# Key Terms

• Attribute: Basic traits like Strength, Charisma, or Intelligence (rated 1–5).
• Ability: Specific skills like Brawl, Subterfuge, or Investigation (rated 0–5).
• Difficulty: Default is 6. Harder tasks may increase it (7–9). Easier ones lower it (4–5).
• Dice Pool: Attribute + Ability = number of 10-sided dice rolled.
• Discipline: Supernatural power. Each has its own effect and may or may not require a roll.

# Sample Dice Pool Combinations

• Strength + Brawl: Physical combat
• Dexterity + Stealth: Sneaking
• Charisma + Subterfuge: Lying or manipulating
• Intelligence + Investigation: Analyzing clues
• Manipulation + Empathy: Reading or influencing emotions

# Disciplines

Use your chosen clan's starting Disciplines. Examples:

• Celerity: Supernatural speed (may allow extra actions or reflexive movement)
• Obfuscate: Hiding in plain sight (no roll unless opposed)
• Presence: Influencing emotions (roll Charisma + Performance or Subterfuge)
• Dominate: Mental control (roll Manipulation + Intimidation)

# Blood Pool

Your blood pool is a measure of how much Vitae (blood) you have available. You spend blood for:

• Healing: 1 blood per health level (1 per turn max)
• Boosting Physical Attributes: 1 blood per +1 (lasts 1 turn)
• Activating some Disciplines
• Appearing human (e.g., warm skin, breathing)

You regain blood by feeding on mortals. Most vampires need to feed every few nights to avoid hunger frenzy.

# Humanity

Humanity is your connection to your moral self. A high Humanity score keeps you grounded, empathetic, and appearing human. A low score makes you more monstrous.

• Gain Humanity by acting with compassion, protecting others, or resisting your Beast.
• Lose Humanity by killing, feeding excessively, or acting cruelly.

Each time you commit an inhumane act, you may roll Conscience to avoid degeneration. Failing that roll causes you to lose a dot of Humanity.

High Humanity makes you more vulnerable to guilt. Low Humanity can cost you control and social acceptability.

# Fire and Sunlight

These are your greatest physical threats.

• Sunlight causes aggravated damage and destroys vampires quickly. Even brief exposure can be fatal.
• Fire causes fear (Rötschreck) and aggravated damage. Vampires instinctively fear fire.

To resist Rötschreck (fear frenzy), roll Courage (difficulty based on severity of fire or light). Failure means you flee or panic.

Never expose yourself to open flame or the sun unless the story leaves no other choice.
