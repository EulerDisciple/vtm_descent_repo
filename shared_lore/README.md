# Shared Lore

This folder is for storing world events, recurring NPCs, symbols, and phenomena that multiple characters may encounter.

## Suggested Files

- `npc_profiles.md`: Names, descriptions, and appearances of recurring characters.
- `timeline_of_events.md`: Major happenings that impact the broader world.
- `sightings_and_symbols.md`: Notes on visions, sigils, and shared supernatural signs.

## Best Practices

- Use clear headings and bullet points for readability.
- Reference sessions or player summaries when possible.
- Keep entries consistent and avoid retconning unless discussed.

This is the "news feed" of the world. Add to it when something crosses into another playerâ€™s storyline or reveals a deeper truth.
