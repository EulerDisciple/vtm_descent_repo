FIRST NIGHT OUT

A Scenario for Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition

Descent into Madness – Scenario 2

# Introduction

You’ve been dead for a week.

Not truly dead, of course. But the world thinks so. You haven’t left your haven since the Embrace. Your Sire’s lessons have been cruel but effective. Tonight, they are not here. They’ve left a message:

“Go. Hunt. Learn who you are.”

You step into the night—alone. The city is no longer yours. You are a predator now. But predators must learn.

# The Hunger Check

You see someone bleeding in a side alley. Not a mortal wound, but the scent hits you hard.

Roll a Self-Control (or Instinct) test. Difficulty 6.

- Success: You walk away. Gain a point of Humanity.
- Failure: You feed—without thought or restraint.

Then, roll Conscience to determine whether guilt or justification follows. A failed conscience check results in a loss of humanity.

# Prey Selection

You must feed tonight. Choose your target:

- A drunk businessman (easy, but morally questionable)
- A lonely student (innocent and unaware)
- A drug dealer (risky, possibly dangerous)

Depending on your method, roll:
- Dexterity + Stealth (to ambush)
- Charisma + Subterfuge (to seduce)
- Manipulation + Empathy (to deceive)

Use relevant Disciplines (Presence, Obfuscate, Dominate) if applicable.

# A Confrontation

You sense another predator—a fledgling feeding messily in a visible location.

Choose your action:
- Confront: Strength + Brawl or Charisma + Intimidation
- Flee: Dexterity + Athletics or activate powers (Celerity, Obfuscate)
- Observe: Intelligence + Investigation to learn more

Let consequences follow your rolls.

# Temptation

As the night ends, you cross paths with someone from your past.

They don’t see you—yet. They meant something to you once.

What do you do? Speak to them? Feed from them? Protect them? Hide?

This moment does not require dice. Only honesty.

# Last Lessons

If they haven’t had an encounter that used at least one discipline, then create an additional encounter or two that allows use of them. Provide prompts as needed.

# Return to the Haven

Dawn approaches. You return, changed.

Reflect on:
- How you hunted.
- What choices you made.
- What kind of predator you became.

End of Scenario 2.
