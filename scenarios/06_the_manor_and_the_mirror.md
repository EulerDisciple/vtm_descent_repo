“I am playing Scenario 6 of a solo Vampire: The Masquerade RPG campaign. Act as the Game Master. Guide me through each scene from this document. Prompt me for decisions at key moments. Offer me choices, allow me to describe my actions, and tell me when I need to roll dice. You may roll for me if I ask. Maintain a gothic horror tone, emphasize internal conflict and psychological tension. Use my Ghost Protocol Sheet to customize NPC responses. Use my scenario 5 document to understand the details of what has happened in the past to work in details into scenario 6. Wait for my input before continuing narration.”

Ensure the player has:

This scenario document

Their updated Ghost Protocol Sheet from Scenario 5

Their character sheet with stats and Disciplines

Handle dice rolls using the V20 system:

Attribute + Ability = number of d10s

Difficulty is usually 6 unless stated otherwise

1s may cancel successes; a roll with no successes and at least one 1 is a botch

At the end of the scenario:

Guide the player in choosing their Mirror’s Mark reward

Prompt them to update their Ghost Protocol Sheet

Do not mention Aris Vey

# Scenario Background

Until the very end of Act 3 when Ashiri names him, Aris Vey’s name will not appear:

In dialogue

Environmental descriptions

Symbolism

Ghost Protocol banter

NPC monologues or documents

Instead, his presence will be implied through:

The encircled falcon sigil

The manor's alive but silent watcher quality

Echoes of manipulation, experiments, and fractured identities

Ashiri referring only to “the one I serve,” “the architect,” or “him”

# ACT I – THROUGH THE SHROUD

### Setup:

At this point, the characters are on Ashiri’s trail. The trail from Scenario 5 leads through desolate countryside—ruined farmland, old-growth forests, and half-paved roads. The deeper they travel, the more the landscape seems off: trees bending toward them, falcon silhouettes appearing in bark and cloud, and moments where time seems to blur.

Let the group travel on foot or in a vehicle. If they use Auspex, Animalism, or Obfuscate, they may get brief glimpses of Ashiri’s aura or whispers in the air.

### Opening Prompt:

"The road narrows. The air thickens. You left the city hours ago, but you feel no closer to your destination. The trees lean in, branches like skeletal arms. The moon is high—and you’re not sure when it rose. Do you press on?"

The players begin their approach to the manor—a surreal journey through twisting forest paths, with unnatural fog and whispering wind.

Scene 1: The Gate of Echoes
They arrive at a twisted wrought-iron gate, half-overgrown, with a rusted sigil of a falcon nearly obscured by ivy.

As they investigate, a whispering wind stirs and each Kindred hears a different voice—familiar, accusatory, or tempting (tailored to ghost protocol background).

Rolls:

Perception + Awareness (Diff 6) to recognize the voice as an illusion or manipulation.

Willpower (Diff 7) to resist reacting emotionally or following a phantom presence.

Occult or Empathy to try understanding the nature of the gate.

If failed, one character may become briefly separated or encounter a projected scene from their past (hallucination).

Scene 2: The Trial of Thorns
As they enter the path beyond the gate, the forest closes in. The air smells of blood and roses. Illusions begin—each character sees someone from their mortal life walking ahead, just out of reach.

Let the player:

Attempt to follow.

Call out.

Ignore it.

“You see them—her. Him. A face you thought gone. Ahead, barefoot, walking slowly into thorns.”

If they interact:

Dexterity + Athletics to keep up.

Self-Control to avoid frenzy or despair.

Courage or Humanity rolls if they attempt to embrace or harm the figure.

Outcomes:

A moment of growth or fracture, depending on how they respond.

Players who reach the figure may witness their own image speaking back to them in falcon-marked robes.

Frenzy and loss of humanity on a failed conscience roll for those who fail

Optional reward: Restore 1 Willpower point for restraint or insight.

Scene 3: Silence Grove
They enter a clearing where sound dies. Not muffled—erased.

A broken fountain stands at the center with black water. Statues of vampires in agony line the edges. Each has a mirrored face.

“You step forward and hear nothing. Not the wind, your breath, or your thoughts. The statues turn slowly—not physically, but perceptually. Their eyes reflect yours.”

This is a conscience trial:

Players may:

Drink from the water

Attempt to smash the statues

Meditate or observe

Rolls:

Conscience (Diff 7) to resist emotional damage

Intelligence + Occult to recognize the illusion

Dexterity + Stealth or Wits + Alertness to avoid traps if aggressive

Outcomes:

Players who drink the water gain insight, but risk a moral loss

Players who smash the statues awaken stone guardians (run a combat scene)

Players who meditate or  observe in the silence may gain a brief vision of the manor and Ashiri’s location.

Transition: The scream of a psychic echo and the fog lifts to reveal the manor’s silhouette.

Scene 3 Transition Prompt:

“The silence ends with a scream—not yours, but inside your mind. When it fades, the forest is gone. Before you lies a vast shape—gothic, impossible, alive. The manor awaits.”

# THE MANOR – STRUCTURED EXPLORATION

### General Theme & Aesthetic

Gothic Victorian architecture, overgrown but pristine—like something dreamt, not built

Black ivy grows inward through windows

Rooms subtly rearrange—doors sometimes lead to unexpected places

The walls absorb sound, and mirrors seem slightly delayed in reflection

Candles flicker even when unlit

### Exterior Approach

Black iron fencing half-sunken into the surrounding forest, hung with dried bloodstained cloth strips (like warding or ritual residue)

Heavy double doors marked faintly with the encircled falcon (obscured by dust or rot)

As the characters approach, Wits + Alertness may detect that their reflections in windows are slightly off—older, bloodied, or marked by the Beast

Pre-entry puzzle:

The doors won’t open unless a drop of vitae is pressed into a specific sigil-carved stone in the gate. Characters must decide who offers blood—and that may be used later to show them something specific inside.

The manor is semi-linear, allowing players to choose routes but nudging them toward the confrontation.

## Exploration Structure for the Manor (Act I–II Bridge)

### ENTRY HALL (Starting Point)

Description: Stone floors, dust-thick air, twin staircases.

A grand mirror at the far end reflects the group with slight distortions.

Two open side doors: one left, one right.

Exits:

Left Wing → The Gallery of Lies

Right Wing → The Library of the Vein

Stairwell (locked magically—only opens once certain triggers are met)

### PATH A – Left Wing: Gallery of Lies

Portraits whisper or scream depending on Humanity levels.

A mirror cracks as they pass, showing one of them standing over a body.

A broken painting frame holds a key fragment—metal, carved with part of the encircled falcon.

One NPC (Ghost Protocol) may be particularly shaken and require support or risk a frenzy.

Trigger: Touching the key fragment weakens the lock on the stairwell.

### PATH B – Right Wing: Library of the Vein

Books record their thoughts or fears.

One book writes, “She watches. She waits. She obeys.” over and over.

A locked drawer contains:

A folded note with Ashiri’s silhouette drawn in blood

The second key fragment

A shadow moves across the ceiling but vanishes when looked at directly.

Trigger: Possessing both fragments unlocks the stairwell magically.

### Optional Side Room – Chamber of Stillwater

May be entered from either wing.

A reflective pool shows their Beast selves or the loved ones they failed.

They may choose to speak their regret aloud or stay silent.

This moment determines how Ashiri addresses them later:

Compassionate if they showed vulnerability.

Cold or mocking if they resisted the trial.

### STAIRWELL UNLOCKED: Leads to Act II

Once both fragments are gathered (or a clever workaround is found—blood sacrifice, Discipline use, or Ghost Protocol suggestion), the locked stairway creaks open.

“A groan of stone and bone—ancient, aching—echoes down the hall. The stairwell yawns open, wide enough for passage, narrow enough for doubt.”

# ACT II – THE CONFRONTATION

### Opening Setup: The Descent

The group descends the narrow stair into the foundation of the manor, which feels more like a cavernous sanctum than a basement. Smooth stone gives way to bone-colored marble, with walls lined in torn velvet and black candles burning without flame.

A voice—female, calm, layered with sorrow and command—echoes from below:

“You came. I told him you would.”

Ashiri stands at the far end of a long ritual hall. Candles form a circle of blood and salt, and two other Kindred stand near her, faces hidden by porcelain masks etched with the encircled falcon.

### Ashiri’s Reveal

Ashiri Background (Not to be immediately revealed to players)

Ashiri was not born. She was built.

Originally a Nosferatu, grotesquely deformed, yet brilliant and persuasive.

She approached Aris Vey seeking transformation, offering her knowledge of the sewers, secrets, and sorcerous ruins in exchange for a chance to be “remade.”

Aris accepted—but twisted the promise. He used experimental blood magic, blending Tremere ritual with living vitae, creating her as a semi-spiritual construct:

A being of flesh, blood, and glyph-bound servitude.

Her body was refined, but incomplete—her beauty is sustained only by his will and the rituals she must obey.

Her Bat-form is not Shapeshifting but the manifestation of her soul—bestial, haunted, fractured.

She is blood bound, yes—but she also clings to the illusion that her beauty and purpose are her own. This is her weakness and her leash.

## How to Reveal This in Act II (Without Giving Away Aris’s Name)

Ashiri’s monologue or response to player pressure might include:

“Do you think I chose this form? I was clay in the dark. I asked to be sculpted. I didn’t know what it would cost...”

“He showed me how to be beautiful—but only while he watches.”

“I am not free. Not truly. And neither are you.”

And if the players attempt to break her bond:

“You would destroy me. If you tried. Because the beauty you see is not mine—it’s his. And he never lets go.”

## Mechanics Integration

If players succeed at Intelligence + Occult, Empathy, or Auspex-based observations, they might notice:

Her aura flickers between serene and broken

Her face is subtly asymmetrical, like a mask over an older form

Her voice stutters when she speaks certain words—sorcerous compulsions

Optional Twist:
 If a player tries to help or redeem her, she might hesitate in giving the attack signal—or even try to stop the fight for a moment—only to be forced by the compulsion to proceed.

She does not immediately attack. Instead, she offers them a choice:

“He has no name for you yet. Only designs. But you’re strong… stronger than expected. I came to warn you—but it may be too late.”

She holds up a vial: blood bound by ritual. It flickers with soulfire.

### Options for Players:

Parley: Attempt to reason with Ashiri. She’ll speak cryptically, but reveals she is both agent and prisoner of “him.”

Manipulation + Empathy (Diff 7) to sway her mood.

Intelligence + Occult (Diff 8) to decipher her bond marks.

Threaten or Strike: If players attack first, she vanishes instantly, and the two masked Kindred engage them.

Delay: If they hesitate or question too long, Ashiri gives a signal and the masked Kindred attack.

GM / GPT Notes

## Combat Goals in This Scene

Show players what it means to fight other Kindred—powers, cunning, ferocity.

Let players use their disciplines and Ghost Protocol allies dynamically.

Reinforce the themes of control vs. instinct—this is not just a brawl; it’s a glimpse into what they might become.

Create room for a moral choice: how far are they willing to go to win?

## Combat: A Bloodbound Triad

The characters fight a trio—a constructed cell of blood-bound Kindred, each fulfilling a distinct tactical role:

### 1. The Blade (Bruiser)

Role: Damage dealer; charges directly into melee

Disciplines: Celerity 2, Potence 2

Tactics: Rushing the strongest PC, splitting off a Ghost Protocol ally

Health: High soak, moderate HP

Notes: He’s the “obvious threat”—meant to draw attention.

### 2. The Mirror (Manipulator)

Role: Psychological warfare and distraction

Disciplines: Dementation 3, Obfuscate 2

Tactics: Breaks the group’s cohesion, targets emotional vulnerabilities

Health: Low soak, moderate HP

Notes: Should trigger Willpower or Humanity checks through illusion use.

### 3. The Chain (Controller/Support)

Role: Battlefield control and ritual caster

Clan: Tremere (or a blood-crafted variant)

Disciplines: Thaumaturgy 2 (Blood Magic), Dominate 1

Signature Rituals:

Bind the Blood (reduces player blood pool regen or disables a Discipline)

Vitae Flare (explodes spilled blood in a small radius)

Tactics: Debuff from the back, protect The Mirror

Health: Moderate soak, low HP

Notes: The most fragile—yet possibly the most dangerous.

### Battlefield Tactics

They fight as a coordinated unit:

The Blade pressures and splits the group.

The Mirror disrupts and sows confusion.

The Chain delays or disables critical abilities.

Let Ghost Protocol NPCs each pick a target or role:

One may go after The Chain instinctively.

Another may defend a weakened PC.

One may suffer a Frenzy or mistake, forcing a tough player choice.

Trigger Options

Ashiri’s restraint fails and she calls them in.

One of the enemies descends from the ceiling, unnaturally positioned.

A warding circle ignites and the three simply rise from it, summoned and waiting.

Optional Difficulty Increase

If the players defeat the triad too quickly or with minimal damage they may reform to fight again. If so this happens thematically as their blood gushes up from the floor reforming their bodies if perfect health.

# ACT III – THE MIRROR

## ACT III – The Mirror

### Tone & Purpose

This act serves four key purposes:

Deliver a psychological and metaphysical climax.

Reveal the name Aris Vey with weight.

Mark a ritual transformation—both narrative and symbolic.

Leave characters and players changed—emotionally and structurally.

### Scene 1: The Mirror Room

As the combat ends, a mirror-lined chamber opens behind a heavy door or warps into existence mid-space. The reflections:

Do not match movements perfectly.

Show Kindred in their Beast state, in torpor, or enthroned in future visions of power.

May speak before the players do.

Ashiri enters—or is drawn into the space involuntarily.

“This is it. The final moment. The last key. It isn’t meant for you—but you triggered it.”

### Scene 2: The Blood Ritual Springs

As the group settles or hesitates, the chamber seals—and the mirror surfaces turn red, rippling with vitae.

Ashiri’s body convulses—runes sear across her skin. She screams but remains upright.

“He… he lied to me…”

“I was never meant to return. I was the ritual.”

Her body begins to rupture, leaking glyph-marked blood. The characters feel their own blood pulse, responding to the chamber.

### GM Notes: The Trap’s Nature

The entire manor was a projected construct, sustained by Tremere blood rituals tied to Ashiri and the Kindred triad.

By killing or engaging the enforcers, the characters triggered the completion of a long-set trap—meant to extract:

Their blood resonance

Their Emotional imprint (reflected in the mirror trials)

A psychic snapshot of their Beast

This trap feeds information and power back to Aris Vey (though he is still unnamed).

### Scene 3: The Shattering

The ritual crescendos:

The mirrors burst, one by one.

Players must resist or embrace what they see:

Humanity check (Diff 7) to reject the dark reflection.

Courage or Self-Control to maintain identity.

They may attempt to:

Escape (Dex + Athletics to avoid falling shards)

Dispel the illusion (Int + Occult or Willpower rolls)

Reach Ashiri and either save or end her

### Ashiri’s Fate & Aris Vey’s Name

If approached: She grabs the hand of the one she trusts most.

If ignored: She collapses into a pile of crimson ash, leaving only her pendant.

#### If Ashiri Dies:

As the blood ritual completes, her body dissolves into crimson ash, but rather than silence, there’s one last whisper:

The ashes swirl in the sudden wind. From within the vortex of red dust, a voice forms—a final breath:

"Aris... Vey."

The name clings to the air like a curse.

At the center of the ash pile rests the pendant:
 A silver bat-wing curled protectively around a small falcon’s eye in obsidian glass—pulsing faintly with leftover blood warmth.

A player may choose to take it.

#### If Ashiri Survives:

If a character reaches her in time, dispels the blood glyphs, or withstands the mirror’s collapse:

She survives, but her glamour or ritual beauty shatters.

She reverts to a horribly twisted Nosferatu form—lips cracked, bones warped, eyes both furious and grieving.

She locks eyes with the character who saved her and says:

“He has a name. And now... you must know it.”

“Aris Vey. He built me. He owns me. But you’ve seen what he is... maybe you still have a chance.”

She presses the pendant into the player’s hand, then fades into shadow, slipping between walls or melting into the floor—gone.

### Integration Notes

The pendant can be used as a blood sorcery focus, a psychic anchor, or simply a narrative object to draw Aris’s attention later.

Only in this moment will Aris Vey’s name be spoken in the campaign—giving it immense narrative weight.

## Scenario 6 Reward: The Mirror's Mark

At the conclusion of the ritual (whether they escape or endure it), each character is left with something… changed. This is not an item or XP upgrade—it’s a permanent shift, as if the ritual saw them, marked them, and left a metaphysical fingerprint.

### Player Prompt at the End:

"As the smoke clears and your mind settles, you feel it. Something remains—not on your skin, but beneath it. In your blood. A ripple of power, a subtle itch of awareness. You were part of the ritual… and it did not let you go cleanly."

## Closing Scene – The Distant Voice, the Lingering Mark

After Ashiri’s fate is sealed—whether through death by ritual or withdrawal after transformation—the chamber begins to disintegrate.

Walls melt like wax. Mirrors burst into shards that float and vanish like ash. The manor fades—not collapses—but unravels, room by room, into a misted void. The characters step back through hallways now brittle and colorless.

As they cross the threshold of the main door, just before it fades entirely, one last thing becomes visible on the far wall:

A phrase, scrawled in coagulated blood and soot, previously hidden beneath layers of illusion:

“You are unfinished.”

Below it, a falcon sigil slashed through with a spiral of thorns—drawn not in ink, but with what looks like clawed fingertips.

And just as the final stones dissolve:

A voice—not from around them, but inside each of them, layered and cold:

"This was the first wound. You’ll learn to bleed deeper."

Then silence.

And they are alone. The stars above unchanged. The earth cold. The pendant heavy in a pocket. The name Aris Vey still clinging to the inside of their skulls.
