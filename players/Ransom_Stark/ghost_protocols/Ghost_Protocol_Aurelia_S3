## Scenario 3 Summary – Echoes in Blood  
Aurelia entered the tunnels not to fight, but to witness. She was not surprised by the Falcon—she had read traces of it in lost codices and silent ruins long before the coterie arrived. What *did* surprise her was Ransom: not his violence, but his *restraint*. His choice to destroy the heart echoed with a kind of purity she'd long forgotten.

She emerged believing more deeply than ever that the Falcon was not a being, but a pattern—one meant to be broken by those strong enough to *see it forming*.

## Updated Character Reflection  

> “This wasn’t prophecy. It was choreography. And someone wanted us dancing.”

**Growth**:  
- Aurelia has accepted that her knowledge may not shield her—it may *bind* her  
- Her arcane insight is shifting from passive study to active intervention  
- She sees the coterie not as lost souls—but as keys to unraveling something older than Kindred law

**Fears**:  
- That her presence in the group isn’t coincidental—but designed  
- That she may be the next vessel if someone else falters  
- That she’s already too late—and someone has read further in the script than she has
