Scenario 2: First Nights – Narrative Summary

Ransom Stark awoke in the suffocating dark of a forgotten crypt—cold stone, ritual markings, and the last echoes of breathless sleep his only companions. The Hunger was immediate. The Beast gnawed. But Ransom did not break.

Cautious and calculating, he explored the crypt’s paths and discovered a dying operative—C. Rourke of the Burial Group—wounded, babbling, and left behind by unseen forces. Before Ransom could intervene, a feral Kindred attacked, snarling and wild, intent on drinking from Ransom’s new-blood vitae. The fight was brutal and personal—close quarters, knives and fists, power newly tasted.

Ransom resisted the Beast’s call, once. Then again. But when survival demanded it, he fed—controlled, precise, enough to survive but not destroy. His mercy extended even to Rourke, stabilizing the enemy’s wounds when no one else would. A path down into blood-stained arcana presented itself, but Ransom turned away—refusing to dive headlong into magic he did not trust.

He emerged into the night through the broken remains of a chapel, neon flickering in the distance. Still hunted. Still unclaimed. But alive—and his own.
