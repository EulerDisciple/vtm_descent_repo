# ChatGPT Storyteller Instructions

Paste this prompt into ChatGPT and upload this document along with the player’s Ghost Protocol Sheet and Scenario 3 outcome summary:

'I’m playing Scenario 4 of a solo Vampire RPG. Please act as the storyteller. Use this document to guide the session scene by scene. Ask me what I do at each moment. Present narrative options, and simulate other characters using Ghost Protocol Sheets. Maintain a gothic horror tone and challenge my character with difficult moral choices. Any time a dice roll is required, offer me a choice to roll myself before rolling for me. If you do not receive both the scenario 4 documentand ghost protocol sheet, please prompt for them before proceeding. Please also prompt me for the scenario 3 summary if available.’

# ACT I – The Lead and the Lure

• The character begins in their haven, reflecting on the events of Scenario 3. Offer choices for how they cope with the strange encounter and sigil.

• A lead emerges—perhaps a recovered address, a scent, or a memory planted by the sigil. It leads to a remote industrial facility on the edge of a state forest. The area is marked by strange smells and clawed trees—hints of Garou territory. Randomly choose one character to put the pieces together and seek the player out confirming his or her own intuition. Together they go to the site and are unsurprised to meet the other two along the way. They may dialogue briefly before arriving.

• Narrate the arrival: fog, overgrowth, and half-shattered barriers. A chill settles over the earth.

• Inside the site (a collapsed processing plant or forgotten observatory). After they arrive, they will meet with Ashiri whom they have only glimpsed out of the corner of their eye or in the background to this point. As a result, give her a thematic entrance in the gothic horror style reflecting her status as a supernatural construct with both a bat and human form. Ashiri appears helpful and composed. However, do not give Ashiri’s name unless it is a direct result of dialogue or other character actions. If the characters do not discover it during the initial discourse, they should find a way to piece it together from their investigation in Act 2 or 3. However, do not give it until they have found it on their own.

Prompt: “You all followed different signs. But you’re here together. And someone else is coming.”

Rolls:
- Intelligence + Investigation to follow the trail
- Perception + Survival to notice supernatural marks
- Wits + Alertness to detect distant movement or breathing

# ACT II – The Task

• Once they have a chance to recover from her arrival and finish any initial discourse, Ashiri offers a task: a “powerful fragment” must be recovered from deeper inside the site. She claims it’s tied to something ancient—dangerous if left unguarded.

• Once the group proceeds, they find a sealed chamber or subterranean vault. Inside is:
  - A partially Embraced human in torpor or bound stasis.
  - Or a strange reliquary dripping vitae.

- Or something similar. Decide for the player based on what fits the scene and their background from the ghost protocol.

• A choice must be made:
  - Feed from it for great power (e.g., one free dot in a Discipline) 
  - Or destroy/preserve it to prevent its abuse (gain a point of self control, humanity, willpower, etc.)

• Ghost Protocol interactions simulate disagreement or temptation.
Whichever is decided explain the mechanics of the reward after the decision is made. Award characters differently based on how they reacted.

Prompt: “The others are watching. What do you do? Do you take it? Do you stop them?”

Rolls:
- Conscience or Willpower to resist temptation (Diff 7)
- Intelligence + Occult to understand the artifact/human’s condition
- Dexterity + Athletics to intervene if conflict erupts

Whichever choice is made, the destruction or taking of the vitae awakens supernatural foes. Shadow monsters of varying shapes that must be battled by the group. Run the full mechanics of the battle including calling for initiative from the players and allowing dice rolls for the results. Choose combat for the ghost protocol characters as fits their personality and use their disciplines. The player should have options for how to fight and use his or her own vampire powers. The creatures should have their own hp and supernatural abilities. The creature abilities should fit in the theme of demoralization (such as psychic willpower attacks or things that invoke destruction of humanity)

# ACT III – The Fracture

• Ashiri is gone—whether the group chooses power or restraint, she vanishes after the decision.

• As they regroup, they find a glyph or journal entry. It references a name: *Arx Alitum*. A memory stirs—this is the first time the name has truly been heard.

• One Ghost Protocol character may question what this means. Another may advocate fleeing. The player chooses whether to pursue, investigate, or escape.

Prompt: “You now know its name. But not its purpose. What will you do with this knowledge?”

• End with tension. The characters may not all trust each other anymore.

Award XP for:
- Choosing restraint under pressure
- Acting decisively in a morally gray moment
- Curiosity that pushes the narrative forward
- Any other actions that were particularly in character or advanced the plot

Also award all characters + 1 occult after successful completion of this scenario reflecting their growing experience with Arx Alitum’s occult practices and their own wild experiences as the marked group for what is to come.
