## 🧠 Psychological Profile

Ransom Stark is a man caught between ghosts and survival. A military veteran shaped by betrayals he never saw coming, his trust in others has withered into a tight coil of instinct and calculation. His pain is private, his anger cold, his decisions sharp. Though he resents power, he cannot help but chase it—if only to stop being prey.

He clings to a fractured moral compass, aiming to do the least harm even when violence is on the table. Yet with every compromise, he loses a piece of the man he once was. He doesn't fear death; he fears *forgetting who he is.*

Ransom is a survivor, not a martyr. But even survivors break—unless they learn what they’ve become and how to wield it.

## ✅ Scenario Progression

### Scenario 2: First Nights
- Emerged from torpor to face his first test as Kindred
- Fought and fed from a feral vampire without losing control
- Resisted the pull of unknown blood sorcery
- Spared an enemy operative and stabilized his condition
- Gained insight into the power and fear surrounding the Falcon symbol

## Scenario 3 Summary – Echoes in Blood
Ransom descended alongside three strangers—Brother Gage, Iris Vale, and Aurelia Knox—drawn together by the symbol of a falcon encircled by thorns.  
He faced his reflection and overcame it with blade and will. Offered the role of vessel for an ancient force, he chose rebellion—destroying the heart at the web’s center.  
This act shattered the falcon’s grip and earned the loyalty—or fear—of those who followed him.  
He emerged from the descent more focused, more dangerous, and no longer willing to be a pawn in anyone’s game.
