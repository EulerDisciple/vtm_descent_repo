# Session Transcript – Scenario 1: Last Light

☗ Opening Scene: The Haven
You awaken to silence. No heartbeats echo in your chest. No sunlight streams through the thick drapes. The room is dim—just the amber flicker of a half-melted candle illuminating the dust.

Your haven is small. Spartan. Empty of life. The scent of blood still lingers faintly on the air, like rust and regret.

On a table lies a folded piece of paper. The handwriting is harsh, angular. You know the hand. Your Sire's.

"This is all I will give you. Hunt. Learn. Become what you are. Or perish as what you were."

There is no name. No signature. Just a thin black thread tied around the parchment—an unfamiliar falcon symbol stamped on wax.

You feel a tension inside you. Something unresolved. A memory clawing its way up from the depths.

🌀 Flashback Begins
The room spins. Shadows bleed inward from the corners. And in a blink—

—you are human again.

You don’t know you’re doomed. Not yet. You don’t know what hunts you, or what seed has been planted in your fate.

But this is the final year of your mortal life.

❓Let’s begin building Ransom Stark
Where are you waking up right now?

Choose one of the following or write your own:

A grimy studio apartment above a bar you work at part-time

A half-finished workshop filled with broken electronics and sleepless projects

A high-rise condo, recently foreclosed, still clinging to memories of better times

A car, parked in a lot you don’t remember driving to

[Write your own idea]

Let me know your choice, and we’ll shape Ransom’s world—and his fall—together.







You said:
Slumped in the corner of an abandoned high rise, I begin thinking over my day. Where did I go wrong? I ask myself. The plan seemed so foolproof and yet here I am holed up in a place where the electricity and plumbing are due to be cut off as soon as the utility companies catch on to me using them, where the meager warmth I generate through a cold fireplace is made by burning junk I pick up on the street
ChatGPT said:
The wind howls through the broken windows like a judgment.

Outside, the city flickers—oblivious to your fall. Inside, the fire cracks and spits against a metal barrel filled with rotting lumber and cracked chair legs. Your breath fogs in the air, a fleeting sign that—for now—you’re still alive.

But you're asking yourself the right question:

Where did it all go wrong?

❖ Character Foundation: The Fall Begins
You were clearly running a plan—a big one. Something that backfired.

Let’s define that. Choose (or write) what Ransom was trying to pull off when it started to slip:

Digital Robin Hood – You hacked into corporate systems to siphon money for the poor (or yourself), but your trail got exposed.

Corporate Inside Job – You were part of a secret R&D lab and tried to sell a prototype or leak secrets. Someone noticed.

Cult Escapee – You were raised or recruited by a weird group promising power, then fled after seeing too much.

Art World Saboteur – You faked a scandal or a theft in the art world to ruin a rival or make a name, but it got too real.

[Write your own idea]

This choice will shape your clan, attributes, and how your story darkens from here. Which path fits Ransom’s doomed brilliance?

You said:
The memory of my recent betrayal still stung. Ringo had promised me that I’d make some easy money if I didn’t ask too many questions. Well I didn’t ask any. I just took the satchels from point A to point B. If point A was typically adjacent to a booming business or research area and point B was a bit seedy, well that wasn’t my problem. After my discharge from the military I was happy for work that was short, clear and high paying 
ChatGPT said:
The taste of ash clings to your tongue—part memory, part the scorched pages you’re burning for warmth.

Ringo’s words still echo.

“Don’t ask. Just carry. Easy payday, soldier.”

And you did. Until the last run. Until you saw the lights in the rearview mirror, until something went wrong at drop-off—gunfire, screams, or worse. You barely got away. You don’t even know what was in the bags.

But you know who they’re blaming.

And you know who vanished the moment it went bad.

☠️ Mortal Archetype: The Betrayed Courier
This tells me a lot about who Ransom was—and where he's headed:

Military Discharge (likely honorable, but under strained circumstances)

Skills: Survival, Athletics, Firearms, Streetwise, Alertness

Attributes: Likely Physical > Mental > Social

Flaw Potential: Haunted, Enemy, or Guilt-Ridden

We’ll define those more concretely in a bit.

✢ Flashback Continues…
It’s been three months since the last job, and the fallout hasn’t stopped.

Let’s define one recent close call that made you realize someone—or something—was hunting you:

Choose or write your own:

You returned to your safehouse to find it trashed, and a crude falcon drawn in blood on your mirror.

A woman in a business suit made you at a coffee shop. She smiled. Then everyone else inside dropped their phones and just stared at you. Silent. Unified.

You were grabbed by two masked men in a van—no words, just a blood test. They let you go after, confused, muttering "not yet."

You got desperate and tried to find Ringo. You traced him to a boarded-up building—but when you went inside, you found yourself sleeping in the basement.

[Write your own]

What happened, Ransom?

You said:
1
ChatGPT said:
You climbed five flights of creaking stairs to your backup hideout—a dusty squat you hadn’t used since summer. The windows were still boarded. The locks untouched. You were sure no one had followed.

But the moment you stepped inside, your gut dropped.

The place had been searched. Carefully. Clinically.
Nothing was broken. Nothing stolen. But everything had been moved.

Drawers half-closed. Mattress slightly off-center.
Your emergency stash? Untouched—but left wide open. Almost like they wanted you to see it.

And then, in the bathroom, scrawled across the foggy mirror in dried blood, was a simple symbol:

A falcon. Wings spread. A single line encircling it.

You ran that night. You haven’t stopped since.

⚙️ Character Sheet Progress
Based on your background so far, here are Ransom’s starting attribute priorities and ability focus (we’ll finalize values at the end of Scenario 1):

Attribute Priorities:

Primary: Physical (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina)

Secondary: Mental (Perception, Intelligence, Wits)

Tertiary: Social (Charisma, Manipulation, Appearance)

Abilities Focus Ideas (subject to growth):

Talents: Alertness, Athletics, Streetwise, Intimidation

Skills: Firearms, Stealth, Survival, Drive

Knowledges: Investigation, Computer (light), Occult (eventual)

Potential Backgrounds:

Contacts (Ringo, or others in his former circle)

Resources (dwindling)

Enemy (the people or things tracking him)

Derangements / Flaws (to be determined):

Mild paranoia? Nightmares? Survivor’s guilt?

❖ Next Decision: Nightfall Event
Back in the flashback—still mortal—Ransom is barely scraping by.

Tonight, he has to make a move: the utilities are failing, the building’s growing colder, and he can’t keep burning trash forever. Something pushes him out the door.

What’s his next action?

Choose or write your own:

Visit an old military contact—someone who might have a spare job or know how to vanish better.

Return to the alley where he made the last drop. Maybe clues remain.

Break into an abandoned office downtown to siphon heat and raid files—Ransom’s getting desperate.

Go to the underground fight circuit. Not to fight. To watch. To remember what power feels like.

[Write your own]

What does Ransom do when the cold sets in… and memory bites harder than frost?

You said:
Enough is enough I say aloud. It’s time to figure what happened. Returning to the scene of the crime is a sure sign of guilt and even I’m not that stupid. But someone must know what happened to Ringo. Every rat has a bolt hole. It’s time to go back to Straton’s pub. Surely someone there has an idea
ChatGPT said:
The fire dies with a hiss. You lace up your boots.

Your breath ghosts in the freezing air as you descend the cracked stairwell of the high-rise—metal door groaning shut behind you. The streets are damp with frozen mist, littered with trash, too quiet. But your feet know the way.

Straton’s Pub
Somewhere between a dive and a death sentence. A hangout for dock workers, ex-military, and third-rate crooks trying to talk like first-rate ones. The kind of place that doesn’t ask questions—because it knows the answers are usually bad for business.

You push open the door. The familiar clink of a bell greets you, though nobody looks up.

Dim lights. Muffled classic rock. A flickering TV above the bar.
Straton himself—same cracked glasses, same stained apron—doesn’t even flinch when he sees you.

"Back from the dead, huh?"

You don’t smile. Neither does he.

❖ Scene Choice: What’s Your Move?
Ransom knows the layout. Knows the regulars. Knows who might talk—if pushed.

Pick one (or write your own):

Talk to Straton directly – The old bastard always knew more than he let on. He might still owe you.

Spot ‘Needles’, a junkie informant who used to ferry messages for Ringo. He’s twitchy, but he owes you a fix.

Slip into the back room and look through Ringo’s old poker ledger. He always used the same code system—maybe something’s there.

Sit, drink, and wait. Make it known you’re back. Let them come to you.

What’s your approach, Ransom?

You said:
I walk up to Straton, I trust him to be straight with me. He’ll be honest or tell me nothing. 
ChatGPT said:
Straton looks you over like a butcher eyeing meat that walked back in.

He doesn’t speak for a moment—just pours from a bottle without asking, a squat glass of something brown and unforgiving. He sets it down between you like a question mark.

“You weren’t supposed to come back,” he says, voice low. Not afraid—just tired.

You don't answer. You never needed to fill the silence with him.

He leans in slightly. "Last I heard of Ringo, he skipped town. Left a mess behind. You were supposed to be in it. And now you’re here, smelling like smoke and bad decisions."

He nods toward the back of the bar, just once.

“You remember Needle?”

❖ Quick Choice: Follow the Thread
Talk to Needle now – See what the skittish wreck knows before he bolts.

Press Straton – Maybe he’s saying more than he means. Maybe he knows more.

Play it cool – Take the drink. Don’t act too eager. See who else is watching.

You’ve opened the door. Which way do you walk through?

You said:
I nod to Straton. He’s told me as much as he can or at least as much as he will. Instinctively I scan the bar while I take a drink. Looking for anything odd before I head over to “talk” to needle 
ChatGPT said:
The drink hits your throat like razors and gasoline. It clears your head—and sharpens your focus.

You scan the room.

Most of the bar is same as ever.

A couple old-timers nursing rotgut.

One guy passed out near the jukebox.

A woman at the far end, face hidden beneath a black hoodie—tapping rhythmically on her glass. Too clean. Too alert.

Needle is hunched in a booth near the back, chewing a stir stick and trying to disappear into the wood grain.

But one thing nags at you.

The TV above the bar is tuned to some late-night local broadcast—just background noise. But the news ticker reads:

BREAKING: Police investigating "containment breach" in Old Docks research facility. Locals report missing persons, blackouts. No official comment.

You didn’t know anything about a research facility. But that last drop?
That alley was near the Old Docks.

Coincidence? Probably. But you’ve learned not to trust those.

Straton doesn’t say a word. Just wipes the bar once. The gesture’s familiar—his way of saying you’re on your own now.

You head to Needle.

He sees you coming. His eyes dart. He twitches. Then freezes.

You slide into the booth.

“...Ransom,” he croaks. Like he’s not sure if he’s praying or panicking.

❖ Confrontation: Needle’s Cracking Point
What’s your tone?

Friendly menace – “We’re old pals, Needle. No reason to make tonight hard.”

Cold directness – “Talk. Or I drag you out behind the bar and we have a private session.”

Desperate appeal – “I don’t care what you know. Just tell me what happened to Ringo.”

What does Ransom say—and how?







You said:
His nervousness reminds me too much of myself 15 years ago. I suddenly feel old, older than I should and as if to remind me I am older than my years the old would in my leg adds a dull ache to the mess. Shunting it aside, I look needle in the eye and say hello needle. Seen Ringo lately


ChatGPT said:
Needle flinches at your voice—but it's not just fear.

It’s guilt.

He stares into his empty glass like it might offer him an exit. His hands tremble, but he doesn’t reach for anything. Doesn’t bolt. You can see it in his eyes: he was expecting this day.

“Ringo’s gone,” he says flatly. “Vanished. Not like skipped town—like… gone.”

You stay quiet. Let him unspool himself.

He licks cracked lips. “Last time I saw him, he was real twitchy. Talking about how ‘they found the drop’. Said you were compromised. Said he had to make it right. Then he gave me a number and said if you came around, I was supposed to call it. Said they’d want to talk to you.”

He pauses. Then leans forward, whispering like the name itself might bite him.

“He was working with people from the Burial Group. Ever hear of that?”

You haven’t.

He slides a card across the table. It’s blank, except for a raised seal in black ink:

A falcon. Encircled. Again.

On the back is a number—local area code. Burned into the paper, not printed.

Needle shivers and adds, “You didn’t hear it from me. I never saw you.”

The moment stretches. And then—

Your leg aches suddenly—burns.
But this isn’t the usual wound.

It’s cold.
Icy.
Like a draft blowing through you.

You look up.
The woman in the hoodie is gone.
The drink in her glass untouched.

Only a single black feather remains where she sat.

❖ What next?
You hold the card. The number. The ache.

How do you proceed?

Call the number – Now. Right here. You need answers.

Pocket the card and get out – You’ve stirred the ashes. You need to move.

Confront Straton again – He had to notice that woman too.

Ask Needle what the Burial Group is – He’s still shaking, but he might know more.

What’s Ransom’s next move?







You said:
I pocket the card and give needle a hard stare as if considering whether the beat him to a pulp though I have no interest in the trouble that would follow. Then I get to me feet and make to walk out. As I near the door though I turn and walk up to Straton, cocking my head to where the girl was in a nonverbal question he’ll have no trouble understanding 
ChatGPT said:
Straton doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t look up.

But he says, quietly:

“You saw her too.”

He polishes a glass that’s already clean. It’s not about the glass.

“She’s been in here twice now. Never orders. Just watches. First time, it was a guy named Halver. Ex-military. You’d’ve liked him. Said he’d ‘seen something he shouldn’t have.’ Two days later, he’s a headline—‘suicide.’”

He finally meets your eyes.

“You’re not gonna be a headline, are you?”

Outside, the cold slaps your face like a warning.

The feather’s still in your hand. Lighter than it should be. As if hollowed out.

You pocket it.

Somewhere in the haze of frost and exhaust fumes, a black car idles across the street. Unmarked. Just watching.

You’re not safe anymore. But you might never have been.

☥ End of Scenario 1: Mortal Descent
We now have enough to define Ransom Stark’s character sheet as we transition into Scenario 2—the moment of Embrace, and his first nights as Kindred.

Would you like me to:

Generate Ransom’s character sheet now (based on his background and choices)?

Continue into Scenario 2, and reveal the Embrace as part of gameplay, then assign stats afterward?

Something else?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

You said:
Scenario 1 is supposed to end with the embrace. Scenario 2 is for testing out the character. Let’s keep running scenario 1 to the point of embrace
ChatGPT said:
Understood—we remain in Scenario 1, and Ransom is still mortal.

We’ll follow the descent to its inevitable end: the Embrace, where everything he’s feared—and everything he’s becoming—finally collides.

❖ Cold Night, Burning Questions
The streets are colder now.

Not just winter-cold. Emptier. The kind of empty that lives behind your ribs.
That card in your pocket—it feels heavier with each step. That feather, too.
The black car hasn’t moved.

There are too many questions. And only one place Ringo ever ran when he was truly desperate. A name only ever muttered once:

The Chapel.

Not a church.
Not really.
Just the husk of one, buried in the industrial ruins near the floodplain. If Ringo was hiding, or dead, or worse—he might be there.

You cut through the alleys.
The wind smells like rust and water and something wrong.

By the time you reach the old stone steps, you feel it: a pull.
Like a wire beneath your skin, drawing you forward.

The door is ajar.

❖ Inside the Chapel
There’s no light except the moon through shattered glass.

Inside, the pews are overturned, warped with mildew. At the altar is a basin—once a font for holy water. Now it’s filled with a black, glistening fluid that doesn’t reflect the light.

And just beyond it, you see a figure.

Ringo.

Or what’s left of him.

Slumped. Pale. Gaunt. Still breathing—but barely. His eyes flutter open as you step forward.

“...I’m sorry, man,” he rasps. “I didn’t know what they were. Thought they were just suits... just money…”

He gags. Black ichor drips from his lips.

Then you hear another voice—not his.

“And yet, here you are.”

It comes from the rafters.
From the dark.

And slowly, something descends—not falling, not floating, but lowering itself, as though gravity is merely optional.

A woman in a black coat, tall and lean, with blood on her mouth and a glint in her eyes that cuts like razors.
The woman from the bar.

She lands silently on the stone floor. Her boots don’t echo.

She looks at you—not Ringo. Just you.

“You’ve seen the falcon. You’ve carried its mark. That makes you mine.”

She takes a step forward.

“But first… a question.”

❖ Final Mortal Choice
She tilts her head. Hungry. Curious.
There’s no fear in her. Only predation wrapped in civility.

“Do you want to live, Ransom Stark?”

Choose:

“Yes.” (You cling to survival—even if it means changing forever.)

“No.” (You refuse. This is a death you choose.)

“What does living mean to you?” (You stall—neither agreeing nor resisting.)

[Say something else]

Your answer determines the tone of your Embrace—but not whether it happens.
That part, tragically, is inevitable.

What does Ransom say?

You said:
3
ChatGPT said:
Her smile widens—not warm, not kind.

Predatory.

Amused.

“Smart. But it won’t save you.”

She circles slowly, boots whispering across cracked stone. Her eyes never leave you.

“To me, living means hunger. It means strength. It means watching the world like it’s a field of wheat and knowing you’ll never starve again.”
“It means no more lies about justice. No more war stories. No more pretending the ones in charge are human.”
“You get to be free, Ransom.”

She stops behind you now. You can’t see her, but you feel her breath near your ear—cold.

“But it comes with a price.”

Then—pain.
White-hot. Searing.
Fangs in your neck.

Your body betrays you. You shudder—not just in agony but in shameful, primal ecstasy.
Something ancient cracks open in your soul.

Your knees give out.

You fall.

You’re fading now.

Ringo’s gone—dead, maybe, or worse.

The chapel is just shapes and shadows.

And then—blood.

Her wrist is at your lips. Torn open. Dripping thick, dark vitae.
It smells like everything you’ve ever craved and never had.

You resist, for one heartbeat.

Then you drink.

☥ Ransom Stark is dead.
And something else rises in his place.

She watches you.

“The Burial Group will come for you. They think you're a mistake. An unauthorized variable.”
“Let them.”

She crouches and places a hand to your chest, where your heart used to beat.

“They’ll call you an abomination. I call you potential.”

She stands.

“Now go, neonate. Hunt. Learn. Become what you are. Or perish as what you were.”

She turns—gone in a blink.

And you rise.
Changed.
Burning.
Hungry.
