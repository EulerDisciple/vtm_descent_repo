DESCENT INTO MADNESS

Story Arc & Scenario Guide

A Vampire: The Masquerade Campaign by Nathaniel Smart

# Campaign Story Arc

This chronicle follows four recently Embraced vampires as they descend into a shadowy world of lies, manipulation, and ancient blood magic. The players begin isolated but are slowly drawn together as subjects in an occult experiment conducted by the secretive organization known only by its symbol: the encircled falcon.

Unknown to them, the organization—later revealed as Arx Alitum—is led by a Tremere elder named Aris Vey, who seeks to transcend vampiric limits by manipulating the humanity of the young. His agent, Ashiri, a supernatural bat-like creature, serves as messenger, manipulator, and saboteur.

The campaign will explore themes of loss, identity, power, morality, and the price of resisting the Beast.

# Scenario Progression Overview

## Scenario 1: The Last Light

Each character begins alone in their haven, reflecting on their Embrace and the last year of their human life. This scenario is introspective and flashback-driven, establishing the character’s origin, morality, and internal voice.

Players make choices that define their clan, attributes, abilities, and Disciplines. These are expressed narratively, with the Game Master (or ChatGPT) gradually walking the player through moral dilemmas, memories, and personality-defining moments.

The scenario ends with the Embrace and the character’s first moment of true thirst.

## Scenario 2: First Night Out

This scenario places the character into the world of the Kindred for the first time. Their Sire is absent, and the player must navigate feeding, danger, and their instincts.

Encounters include a Hunger check, a moral choice of prey, a run-in with another Kindred, and a vision or emotional trigger. The emphasis is on trying out their stats and powers while grounding their internal struggle with the Beast.

This night marks their transition from victim to predator. The decisions made here set emotional tone and habits that carry forward.

## Scenario 3: Web of the Falcon (Revised)

The four characters are independently drawn to the same location—a derelict church, repurposed Elysium, or subway crypt—by dreams, compulsion, or manipulated coincidence. This is the first time they meet.

The challenge they face is moral in nature: a staged masquerade breach, a mortal dying in public view, or an accidental frenzy gone too far. They must decide together how to clean up the situation or let the consequences fall. Tension arises from conflicting moral approaches and the first glimpse of the encircled falcon symbol burned into stone.

Ashiri is present, disguised as a bystander or priestess figure. She watches, records, and gently prods toward uncomfortable choices. She remains unnamed and unknown.

## Scenario 4: Broken Threads

Bound by circumstance, the coterie investigates the origin of the symbol. They find a trail—an abandoned haven, lost documents, Kindred whispers—that leads them to Ashiri. She appears to help, offering visions or clues and proposes a task: recover a tome or destroy a rogue vampire.

Her true purpose is to test the group’s cohesion and trigger internal conflict. The mission is rigged to go wrong. By the end, the coterie uncovers the name 'Arx Alitum' and the existence of a controlling figure in the shadows.

## Scenario 5: Ashes of Trust

The group returns to Ashiri—perhaps with some minor suspicions but mostly to obtain her help putting pieces together. Before they can act, their haven is attacked by supernatural creatures (possibly werewolves corrupted by blood sorcery). Ashiri is seemingly kidnapped.

The group is scattered. One or more members may be taken. The survivors track Ashiri’s trail, now unsure of her loyalties, and discover deeper ties to the occult.

## Scenario 6: The Manor and the Mirror

The trail leads to an old manor belonging to Aris Vey. Infiltration is required. The characters face illusions, trials of conscience, and spiritual torment. They discover Ashiri’s true allegiance to Arx Alitum.

The campaign’s central villain is named, though he escapes. The group leaves changed—wounded, perhaps bonded, and aware that the true war is only beginning.

## Scenario 7+: ???

Beyond this point, the campaign becomes open-ended. Potential goals include hunting Aris Vey, dismantling Arx Alitum, saving those being manipulated, or becoming something darker themselves.

# Key Figures

## Aris Vey

An ancient Tremere, scholar of blood alchemy, and patient predator. Aris Vey avoids politics, focusing instead on forbidden transformation. He believes blood reshaped through suffering yields a purer path to power.

He operates through long-term manipulation, psychological testing, and ritualized trials. His ultimate goal is to ascend past generational limits without confronting elder Kindred directly.

Known only by symbol in early scenarios. Ruthless, subtle, brilliant.

## Ashiri

Ashiri appears as a haunting woman or shadowy bat. She is Aris Vey’s agent and experiment. Capable of speech and charm, she plays friend, prophet, or false guide.

Ashiri’s motives are complex—she may be bound by blood, fear, or even twisted loyalty. She orchestrates the early trials and appears helpful, even nurturing, while quietly documenting the fall of each character.

Her name is discovered in Scenario 6. Until then, she is the ever-watching shadow in the background.
