# Vampire: The Masquerade â€“ Descent into Madness

Welcome to your solo or shared chronicle. This repo supports players running story-driven campaigns with ChatGPT as the GM. Each player stores session logs, Ghost Protocol summaries, and character histories in their folder.

## Structure

- `scenarios/`: Markdown-based solo scenarios
- `players/<name>/`: Transcripts, summaries, and Ghost Protocol sheets
- `shared_lore/`: NPCs, events, and recurring symbols
- `tools/`: Prompts, templates, and dice macros

To begin, copy a scenario from `scenarios/` into your session log and start playing using the instructions in the prompt file.
