# 🧛 Descent into Madness  
*An async Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary chronicle powered by ChatGPT and GitHub*

Welcome to a unique solo storytelling experience where each player runs their own campaign using ChatGPT as the Storyteller, but your actions shape a **shared world** with other Kindred. Scenarios are played one-on-one, but your transcripts, discoveries, and changes live on in GitHub.

> 🧠 You don’t need to know Git or be a coder.  
> 🧃 You *do* need imagination, curiosity, and a hunger for story.
