I have completed two solo roleplay scenarios in a Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition campaign. Please help me summarize the character I’ve become by analyzing the transcripts from Scenario 1 (my human past and Embrace) and Scenario 2 (my first night out as a vampire).

1. Review my decisions, actions, and emotional responses.
2. Fill out the “Ghost Protocol Sheet” below with as much specific detail as possible.
3. Provide a short paragraph of thematic context for my character’s place in the world. The themes are Gothic horror and a descent into madness. The focus should be on character psychology and vulnerabilities to pushes toward the descent to madness.
4. The results will be used to represent my character in crossover scenes in future scenarios. Be as true to the character’s tone and choices as possible.

Here is the format I’d like you to follow:
