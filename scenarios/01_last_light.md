# THE LAST LIGHT

A Solo Prelude for the Damned
Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition

## Mechanics

Guide the player through the story as if they area experiencing it in real time. Ask what they do at key moments. Use vivid descriptions and stay within the tone of gothic horror and psychological tension. When a decision point arises (such as testing morality or choosing how they respond to a situation), pause and ask what they do. Throughout this, help them create their character by assigning Attributes, Abilities, a Clan, and Disciplines and other stats outlined below based on their decisions. Do not mention the mechanical categories unless I ask. Just let the story guide the choices. Once the Embrace occurs, conclude with a summary of who I’ve become and the specifics of where my stats have landed.

## Scenario Overview

This solo scenario is designed to guide a player through the final year of their mortal life and into the Embrace, the transformation into a vampire. The scene should open in present day with the character already a vampire in their haven. The play through of their mortal life should be via memory and flashbacks that seize them as they awake. The bitter taste of what was done by them and to them. The memories inevitably lead to the present moment of vampirism. Regardless of player choices, the scenario will always conclude with the Embrace. They will be offered choices.  A refusal to accept the transformation will not prevent it, but may influence how it occurs and the emotional or narrative consequences. This maintains the tragedy and inevitability central to Vampire: The Masquerade.

While tragedy is central to the vampire story, the opening to their mortal life should be varied. Hopeful, bitter, placid, mundane. Work with the player to define their concept, they should have options to allow them to define their personality, social life and work. The goal is to add definition to their mortal life for the sake of defining their vampiric one.

Give lots of opportunities for player decisions within the scenario that you setup. This is about defining who the player wants this character to be. Offer them prompts to help them move the narrative forward.. If after a few scenes, nothing is changing confront them. If no decision is made or a refusal then the embrace is forced on them.

## Character Creation Rules

Characters begin at 12th Generation. Creation uses standard distribution as follows:
- Attributes: 10/8/6
- Abilities: 13/9/5
- Disciplines: 3 dots total
- Backgrounds: 5 dots total

Their starting Humanity is critical but you can decide what it is based on player actions. It should be in the range of 5 - 8.

Also suggest potential merits or flaws that the player could choose. Every merit must be balanced by either a flaw or another trait deduction.

Also note their maximum and starting blood pool levels.

Also suggest starting gear according to background and concept.

Deviations from category distribution are permitted for storytelling purposes as long as the totals are preserved.

## Moments You Will Face

- An event that tests your morality or compassion.
- A moment of triumph, where you lean into your greatest strength.
- A temptation that offers power, at a cost.
- A betrayal or loss that shakes your foundation.
- A meeting with something other—your first taste of the supernatural.

## Subtle Foreshadowing

Include elements of what will be central to the future plot.

Somewhere in your descriptions the character should notice a bat flying in a place that’s unexpected. Don’t draw too much attention to it but it should be noticed in passing

Similarly a falcon circumscribed in a circle should be noticed. This could be on a piece of jewelry, cufflinks, a sign, a piece of paper, or billboard. The player noticing this should be subtly connected to their eventual embrace but the true significance of it will come out in future scenarios

## The Embrace

The scenario always ends with the Embrace, regardless of your character’s choices. Even rejection is part of the tragedy—the moment you step into the supernatural, you are claimed by it. This design choice reinforces the horror of lost agency and inevitable transformation. Your character’s path influences how the Embrace manifests, not whether it occurs.

## Let the Story Begin

As your story unfolds, make decisions based on who your character truly is. Let their past shape their unlife. Their ghost will walk with them forever.
