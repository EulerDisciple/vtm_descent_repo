## Notes
Aurelia doesn’t fight unless cornered—she talks, bribes, or binds. Her calm, tactical mindset provides a cold contrast to Ransom’s directness. She knew Ransom’s sire and claims she can’t say more yet.

## Scenario 3 Hook
Aurelia arrives uninvited, citing a debt owed to the player character’s sire. She claims the upcoming events involve a power vacuum too dangerous to ignore—and she intends to manage the fallout.
