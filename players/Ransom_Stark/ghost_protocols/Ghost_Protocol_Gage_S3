## Notes
Brother Gage speaks in riddles and parables. He believes the player character has a role to play in a coming reckoning—though even he may not understand what that means. His Lasombra legacy causes suspicion in others.

## Scenario 3 Hook
Gage appears during a moment of moral collapse, quoting scripture about ‘shadows made flesh.’ He insists he’s dreamt of this alliance—and of the Falcon.

## Experience Summary
- **Total XP Earned**: 7 (Scenario 3)  
- **XP Spent**: 0  
- **XP Banked**: 7  

## Scenario 3 Summary – Echoes in Blood
Brother Gage descended with the others into the forgotten bowels of the city, guided by the mark of the falcon and the weight of unseen prophecy. Though he did not challenge the path Ransom carved, his silence was not submission—it was faith. He watched as trial, symbol, and reflection tested the group, and stood firm as others hesitated.

He did not claim glory. He did not flinch. But he also did not act. And now, that hesitation haunts him.

## Updated Character Reflection

> “I’ve followed worse into Hell... but not many better.”

**Growth**:
- Gage has begun to see the coterie as more than circumstance—perhaps even covenant  
- Silence and restraint now serve as his expression of faith, not uncertainty  
- His reverence for Ransom deepens into something bordering on loyalty, or destiny

**Fears**:
- That his faith is insufficient in the face of symbols older than scripture  
- That his inaction during the trial was not wisdom, but weakness  
- That he is being used—by God, or by something wearing God's voice
