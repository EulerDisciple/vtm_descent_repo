Descent into Madness – Scenario 5 Upload

# ChatGPT Storyteller Instructions

Paste this prompt into ChatGPT and upload this document along with the player’s Ghost Protocol Sheet and Scenario 4 outcome summary:

'I’m playing Scenario 5 of a solo Vampire RPG. Please act as the storyteller. Use this document to guide the session scene by scene. Ask me what I do at each moment. Present narrative options, and simulate other characters using Ghost Protocol Sheets. Maintain a gothic horror tone and challenge my character with difficult moral choices. Any time a dice roll is required, offer me a choice to roll myself before rolling for me. If you do not receive both the scenario 5 document and ghost protocol sheet, please prompt for them before proceeding. Please also prompt me for the scenario 4 summary if available.’

# ACT I – The Return and Accusation

• After the events of the previous scenario the group gathers together at a suitable location. Choose a haven from one of the characters (whoever is most likely to be hospitable based on the ghost protocol).

• They should have the option of looking into Arx Alitum via prompt and several other potentials, but all their searching (regardless of number of success) should at best provide vague clues and rumors. A critical success might discover that an unnamed Tremere is whispered to lead them.

• Upon discussion with the group after their failed attempts to find out more, they brainstorm alternative options. A successful investigation or supernatural revelation or leveraging a mentor or contacts (if a character has the relevant background), the group realizes that their best bet is to locate Ashiri and confront her.

• Before setting out, someone in the group (whoever is likeliest based on ghost protocol) should suggest they get themselves some proper gear before another confrontation. Based on appropriate backgrounds such as resources, contacts, allies, etc. the group should make rolls or play out finding appropriate gear. No supernatural weaponry should be found unless it’s appropriate based on a character’s backgrounds and stats.

• The coterie set out to locate Ashiri. The characters should roll for searching. Based on the results the GM can provide some of these options for where to look:

- Return to a previous place they encountered Ashiri (pull specifics from scenario 4 summary)

- Where one of the character’s embraces took place (pull specifics from the ghost protocol)

- if they do a more general rumor search they will find out about a vampire that was kidnapped and can look for A location where a vampiric kidnapping recently took place. This would be found by contacts/mentor (if appropriate for character traits), or a discipline ability such as auspex (following an aura), animalism (rumors from rats), or other appropriate abilities.

• Wherever they end up the scene should show signs of recent violence, a neonate was forcibly carried off from here the blood is dried and old but within a week or two. A fresh falcon sigil fitting a gothic theme can be found upon inspection on the premises.

• Following the trail from here (with appropriate rolls and thematic detail filled in), they are able to find Ashiri.

• She is waiting in a hollowed ruin, seemingly calm and unguarded. They begin to discourse with her.

• Dialogue should be intense. Use Ghost Protocol characters to press her for answers or explode in anger. Ashiri remains evasive but not overtly hostile.

• As they demand clarity, a strange silence descends. The smell of earth and pine thickens. Then it happens: an attack.

• The haven is invaded by monstrous forms—bestial, primal, possibly Garou or corrupted wolf-things. The characters’ may theorize these are controlled by Arx Alitum.

Rolls:
- Wits + Alertness to react to danger
- Dexterity + Athletics to dive for cover
- Use full initiative mechanics for all involved

# ACT II – The Assault and Escape

• Run full combat including initiative. Track everyone’s HP and blood points.

• Werewolf-like creatures use Willpower-destroying fear attacks, damage tied to loss of self-control in addition to their magical, aggravated damage claws.

• There should be a chief werewolf who wields fire in some form. The vampires will be confronted for the first time with one of their kind’s greatest fears and will have to overcome it or be driven into savage fear and frenzy. Appropriate courage and/or willpower rolls required.

• Creatures should be fast, savage, and intelligent. Let each Ghost Protocol Kindred fight in their own style.

• Offer the player choices: defend Ashiri, escape alone, save another Kindred.

• During the chaos, Ashiri is taken by one of the creatures. Describe it dragging her into shadow.

• Optional: 1–2 player characters may also be captured based on decisions and rolls.

Rolls:
- Strength + Brawl or Firearms for damage
- Courage or Willpower to resist fear (Diff 7)
- Intelligence + Survival to navigate escape

Prompt: “Do you fight? Run? Try to save them? What matters most right now?”

# ACT III – Ashes and Resolve

• The survivors gather—shaken, bloodied, furious.

• The location is in ruins. Strange glyphs glow faintly where the monsters vanished.

• Upon investigation the characters discover two things:
1. A trail remains. Evidence leads toward Arx Alitum’s sanctuary.

2. The kidnapped Kindred was ritually sacrificed. Set the scene appropriately for the gothic horror theme. However, the method of death should fit Arx Alitum’s dark purpose. Particularly, the death should have been self-inflicted in some way and the vitae gathered in what is clearly a ritualistic pattern. Reactions to this should be per ghost protocol but also offer the player a choice such as licking up the remnants (they will not find any but have chosen power at the cost of humanity), compassion or disgust, etc.

• No matter what the characters decide (even if they attempt to destroy the ritual), they unintentionally reactivate the ritual (GM to setup some fitting device such as activating a falcon sigil with blood from an injury a character received). Whether the activation is intentional or unintentional should have an impact on their humanity and final stats. However it is activated, the characters undergo the dark magic which should be fittingly described. The end result is that they all lower their generation to 9 (max blood pool 14, 2 blood points spent per turn), their wounds are all healed and their blood pool is maxed out.

• All characters are overawed by the experience: horrified, exhilarated, etc. based on ghost protocol.

• The Ghost Protocol characters debate. The player must decide whether to track Ashiri, retreat, or regroup.

Prompt: “You survived. But at what cost? And what dark purpose awaits those chosen by Arx Alitum?”

Award XP for:
- Heroism or sacrifice during battle
- Tactical ingenuity or power use
- Moments of fear, grief, or moral complexity
- Choosing to lead or protect another Kindred

All characters should gain a discipline of their choice (must be in their clan or a new one that is not clan specific), they should gain or lose humanity based on their actions (GM should decide if they gain, lose or stay the same based on their actions), and gain an ability (offer several options based on their actions).

Provide a narrative outcome summary of Scenario 5 for input into Scenario 6. Include key moments (e.g., who was captured, who escaped, how the battle unfolded). Also output an updated Ghost Protocol Sheet with revised stats, new scars or traits, and thematic growth.

Here are the requirements for the updated ghost protocol sheet
