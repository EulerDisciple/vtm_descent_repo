## 🧠 Psychological Profile

Ransom Stark is a man caught between ghosts and survival. A military veteran shaped by betrayals he never saw coming, his trust in others has withered into a tight coil of instinct and calculation. His pain is private, his anger cold, his decisions sharp. Though he resents power, he cannot help but chase it—if only to stop being prey.

He clings to a fractured moral compass, aiming to do the least harm even when violence is on the table. Yet with every compromise, he loses a piece of the man he once was. He doesn't fear death; he fears *forgetting who he is.*

Ransom is a survivor, not a martyr. But even survivors break—unless they learn what they’ve become and how to wield it.
